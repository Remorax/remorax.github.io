I am a 2nd year PhD student in NLP at the [University of Edinburgh](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) (2022-current). I'm a part of the [Machine Translation (StatMT) research group](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/statmt/statmt+Home) there, supervised by [Dr. Alexandra Birch](https://sites.google.com/view/alexandra-birch/). 

Broadly, I am interested in adapting NLP models for the long tail of *under-represented languages and cultures* across the globe. Currently, I am working on **multilingual NLP** (including synthetic instruction tuning for multilingual LLMs, low-resource MT and generation) as well as **multicultural NLP** (*transcreation* for cross-culturally understandable generation).

<!-- In the past, my experience has been quite diverse, and I've published in top *ACL conferences on modelling for low-resource LLM-MT [[1]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.americasnlp-1.25/), resolving ambiguity in MT [[2]](https://aclanthology.org/2023.wmt-1.44/)[[3]](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.859), synthetic pretraining for multilingual NMT [[4]](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-eacl.72) and, in another life, on ontologies too [[5]](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.842). -->
