I am a PhD student in the [EdinburghNLP department](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. Specifically, I'm a part of the [Machine Translation (StatMT) research group](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/statmt/statmt+Home), supervised by [Dr. Alexandra Birch](https://sites.google.com/view/alexandra-birch/) and [Dr. Jeff Pan](http://knowledge-representation.org/j.z.pan/). 

Broadly, I am interested in **Multilingual**, **Multicultural** and **Multimodal** Machine Translation and Generation, motivated by the vision of extending AI to the long tail of languages and cultures across the globe. Recently, I've expored self-supervised pretraining in MT & speech, speech-text modality adaptation, ambiguity resolution, and code-switching in MT scenarios. Additionally, I am passionate about utilizing external structured knowledge in NLP tasks for effective grounding, reliability, and customizability.
